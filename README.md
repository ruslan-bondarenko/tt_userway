REQUIREMENTS

1. Create a custom Javascript function that scans the DOM and find all IMG elements on the page and add/rewrite «alt» attributes to randomly generated words.
2. You can get random words for images alt attributes from this
endpoint: https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/word?number=1
3. The updated IMGs tags should be highlighted on the page.
4. When we click on the IMG element, an input field should appear to change the text of the alt attribute.
5. Support dynamic content: Your code should properly handle
adding/removing new IMG elements and add/rewrite «alt»
attributes.
6. Now make it look good! Please use CSS to ensure the element’s
focus is sufficiently highlighted with a high contrast CSS border
color.
7. Ensure cross-browser compatibility across, Edge, Chrome, and FF.
8. Do not use any 3rd party libraries such as jQuery, etc. Use only pure Javascript that you author specifically for the purpose of this test.
9. Your code should be encapsulated in a single Javascript function that is injectable into any html page. Our team will review your work by injecting in into various pages on the internet.
10. Please email your test results to both Artem (artem.lanovyy@userway.org) and Leo (leo@userway.org).
